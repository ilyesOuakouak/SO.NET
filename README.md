<p>
  1 - You need a local server installed in your computer. In my case, i use Xampp <br>
  2 - Create a database and call it "<strong>socialNetDb</strong>" <br>
  3 - Import the database "<strong>socialNetDb.sql</strong>" which you find inside <strong>home_functions</strong> folder <br>
  4 - Move the whole folder into your <strong>htdocs</strong> <br>
  5 - Open your favorite browser and type "<strong>localhost/"path of the folder (ex: localhost/social network)"</strong>"<br>
  6 - Here you go, you've done !!!
